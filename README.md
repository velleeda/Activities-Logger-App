# Activities Logger App

## Technologies

- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

I decided to use React because I'm more familiar with it and it's the framework I've studied so far, I'm trying to get used with TypeScript that's why I used it, I'm used to use Sass in my projects, but I'm also familiar with styled-components.
